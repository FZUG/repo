*vi-help.txt*	For Vim version 7.1.  Last change: 2008 Mar 03

			VIM - minimal  help file
  (NOTE: This is a minimal help file and many tags won't work. Use 'vim' or
   'gvim' to read the complete help docs.)
									 k
      Move around:  Use the cursor keys, or "h" to go left,	       h   l
		    "j" to go down, "k" to go up, "l" to go right.	 j
Close this window:  Use ":q<Enter>".
   Get out of Vim:  Use ":qa!<Enter>" (careful, all changes are lost!).

Jump to a subject:  Position the cursor on a tag between |bars| and hit CTRL-].
	Jump back:  Type CTRL-T or CTRL-O (repeat to go further back).

Get specific help:  It is possible to go directly to whatever you want help
		    on, by giving an argument to the ":help" command |:help|.
		    It is possible to further specify the context:
							*vi-help-context*
			  WHAT			PREPEND    EXAMPLE	~
		      Normal mode command      (nothing)   :help x
		      Insert mode command	  i_	   :help i_<Esc>
		      Command-line command	  :	   :help :quit
		      Command-line editing	  c_	   :help c_<Del>
		      Vim command argument	  -	   :help -r
		      Option			  '	   :help 'textwidth'
  Search for help:  Type ":help word", then hit CTRL-D to see matching
		    help entries for "word".

VIM stands for Vi IMproved.  Most of VIM was made by Bram Moolenaar, but only
through the help of many others.  See |vi-credits|.

3. Credits                              *vi-credits* *vi-author* *vi-Bram* *vi-Moolenaar*

Most of Vim was written by Bram Moolenaar <Bram@vim.org>.

Parts of the documentation come from several Vi manuals, written by:
        W.N. Joy
        Alan P.W. Hewett
        Mark Horton

The Vim editor is based on Stevie and includes (ideas from) other software,
worked on by the people mentioned here.  Other people helped by sending me
patches, suggestions and giving feedback about what is good and bad in Vim.

Vim would never have become what it is now, without the help of these people!
